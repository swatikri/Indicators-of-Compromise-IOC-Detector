- Place your honeypot.json file in the same directory as the folder you run the code from
  or provide the complete path on line 68 in the code, as follows:
  for line in open('honeypot.json', 'r'):
  Change ‘honeypot.json’ to your path/to/honeypot.json.

- Run the code as follows :
 python threatintel.py 8.8.8.8,44621,e7ae40d25a6da15cdd3712f4f55153ac,www.abc.com 
 where the comma separated strings are your IOCs.

- Parsing the file and querying may take some time. Please be patient and follow the instructions
  on your terminal (and do reply with yes in most cases for a more detailed threat report)!
